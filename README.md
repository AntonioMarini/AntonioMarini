### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student with an
excellent ability to learn and always
explore new technologies, through a
solid foundation of more than 7
years of programming and knowledge
of its main paradigms (especially
OO), algorithms and data structures.
Experience in several personal
projects and in teams by adopting
Agile frameworks such as SCRUM
and Kanban.
